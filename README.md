# Wet_Dream
Wet Dream is a proof-of-concept atmospheric water generator (AWG) designed to harvest water from ambient air, providing a sustainable source of drinking water. The project includes:

- Thermodynamic modeling of the vapour-compression refrigeration cycle
- Python scripts for calculating pressures, temperatures, enthalpies, and entropies at all key points in the cycle
- Coefficient of performance (COP) and efficiency analysis
- Potential for expansion to real-world air–water extraction prototypes

This repository is intended for engineers, students, and hobbyists interested in renewable water generation and thermodynamic cycle simulation.
